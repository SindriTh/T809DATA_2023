Features 3 and 4 seem to fit best with feature 1, 
Feature 1 is radius_mean
Feature 3 is perimeter_mean	
and Feature 4 is area_mean	

This makes sense, as the radius, perimeter and area of a circle are all related to each other.
The slight varience seen in feature 4 is likely due to the fact that the "circle" is misshapen.

There also seems to be slight correlation between 21, 23, and 24 which correspond to:
radius_worst
perimeter_worst
area_worst

This makes sense that these features would be correlated as well, as they are all related to the size of the circle.
