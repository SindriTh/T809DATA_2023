In the eigenvalue plot, the high initial values show that the first few components capture most of the data's main patterns. 
The rapid drop indicates that later components add little new information.

The cumulative variance plot shows the total information captured as we add components. 
The sharp rise at the start tells us the first few components are very informative. 
The leveling off means that adding more components doesn't give us much more insight.

The PCA has compressed the original 30 features into a few significant PCs, capturing most of the dataset's variance. 
Using this dimensionlity reduction helps a lot, especially when features contain correlated information.
