The accuracy of the k_means prediction was: 0.82
The confusion matrix was:
[[50  0  0]
 [ 0 40 10]
 [ 0 17 33]]

This is a rather low accuracy, but as can be seen on the confusion matrix,
the model is very good at predicting the first class (Versicolor), but easily gets
confused between Setosa and Virginica.
